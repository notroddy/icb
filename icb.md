# Background
- There is a game called Ice Cold Beer.
- The objective of the game is to place a metal ball in the correctly lit hole.
- There are 10 holes.
- If you place the ball inside of the wrong hole, then you lose a ball
- If you place the ball inside of the correct hole, then you receive the points that are on the display
- You start out the game with 3 balls. Once those are gone, the game is over.
- However, each time your score has 2000 in the thousandsth place (ex: 2000, 12000, 22000, 32000, etc), you receive a bonus ball.
- There is a display on the bottom left of the game that displays which ball you are on, the current amount of points you can obtain for that hole, your total score, a star to signify if you've completed one loop (Putting the ball in holes 1 through 10), and a game over light.

# Requirements
- I have a webcam.
- I want to use Python to do the following:
    - Track the path of the ball
    - Track which hole is lit.
    - Track if the ball goes in the wrong hole.
    - Track the score
    - Track how long a player has been playing
    - Track how many loops an individual has done.
    - I want to track how long it takes per each hole to complete.
    - I want to track how long it takes to do a loop.
    - I want to display the time, total score, the hole score, how many loops, how long that particular hole takes to complete, the fastest loop created.
    - You can know which hole the ball is to go in as it will be lit up from the inside.
